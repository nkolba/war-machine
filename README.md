Simulation of card game *War* using *D3* and *Webworkers*.

## Intro

I grew playing the card game war.  This is an increadibly dull and 100% deterministic game where a deck is divided between the players (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)).  A question I've often used in tech interviews is to design a program that plays War.  Much to my amazement, almost no-one I've ever interviewed has heard of the game.  So, one day I decided to try doing it myself...  I found that its a fun way to generate a large random dataset - which could be vizualized using d3.  I also found that running the game multiple times is a good test for webworkers as well.
